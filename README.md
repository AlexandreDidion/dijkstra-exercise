# Dijkstra-exercise - Disjktralex Rails API

Rails API for the [Ember Octane](https://github.com/AlexandreDidion/dijkstra-front) exercise implementing a Dijkstra Algorithm for two countries: Belgium and France. 

I did not create the algorithm myself, I took [this one](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Ruby) and modify it a bit to fit my needs.
